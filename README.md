# SQL Foundational Concepts

## Exercise 1
This file contains the basic fundamentals of SQL and the basic concepts of database construction and querying.

It contains the structure of a sales database

### Deliverables:<br/>
-- Calculate the average quantity

-- Calculate the number of sales made

-- Calculate the maximum quantity sold

-- Calculate the minimum quantity sold

-- Calculate the total sales made

-- Calculate the Total Sales Amount by Customer

-- Calculate the Total Quantity Sold by Product

-- Calculate the Average Quantity Sold per Customer
                                                     
-- Customers with Total Sales Amount Greater Than $1500

### Implementation
The deliverables were met using the following concepts:
1. <b>Count</b>
2. <b>Sum</b>
3. <b>Average</b>
4. <b>Maximum</b>
5. <b>Minimum</b>


## Exercise 2
The file contains the construction of a sample database classicmodels derived from my SQL sample databases

The Exercise brings more complex concepts of <b>JOINS</b> into light

### Deliverables:<br>
-- Question 1 : What is the total number of orders placed in the year 2005?

-- Question 2 : Find the names and contact information (city, country) 
-- of all customers from Germany who have placed orders with a total amount exceeding $500.

-- Question 3 : Find the product line with the highest average order quantity.

-- Question 4 : How many different employee offices are there in the database?

-- Question 5 : Find the names of all employees who manage at least one employee 
-- who has completed more orders than the average number of orders per employee.

-- Question 6 : Find the total number of orders placed between the first day of the current month and today's date.

-- Question 7 : List all products with a price exceeding $100. 
-- Include an additional column indicating "High Price" for these products and "Low Price" for products with a price of $100 or less.

-- Question 8 : Find the product with the most orders placed in total.

-- Question 9 : Find the top 5 customer cities (by city name) with the highest total order amounts.

### Implementation
The deliverables were met using the 

## Exercise 3
The file also contains the structure of a sample database, classicmodels, derived from my SQL sample databases

### Deliverables:<br/>
-- Question 1: Create a view named high_value_customers that lists the customer number, customer name, and total order amount for customers who have placed orders exceeding $10,000.

-- Question 2: Find the names of customers who have placed orders for products from the 'Classic Cars' product line.

-- Question 3: List the employees who work in the office with the maximum number of employees.

-- Question 4: Write a stored procedure named get_customer_orders that takes a customer number as input and returns the order numbers and order dates for that customer.

-- Question 5: Write a stored procedure named total_sales_by_employee that takes an employee number as input and returns the total sales amount for that employee.

-- Question 6: Use a CTE to find the top 3 employees by the number of customers they manage.

-- Question 7: Use a CTE to find the average payment amount for each customer and list those with an average payment greater than $2000.

-- Question 8: Create a union query that lists all customer names and employee names.

-- Question 9: Write a union query to list all office cities and customer cities, making sure there are no duplicates.

-- Question 10: Create a union query that lists all product codes from the orderdetails table along with the respective order number and indicates whether it is from the 'Classic Cars' or 'Motorcycles' product line.

### Implementation
The deliverables were accomplishes using concepts of:<br/>
1. <b>Views</b>
2. <b>Procedures</b>
3. <b>Joins</b>
4. <b>CTEs</b>
5. <b>Unions</b>
